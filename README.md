## Other Info:

- Members will have to register themselves with /register and their Steam Friendcode to appear on the Leaderboard and get the Roles.
- When a new season reset comes around, change the timestamp in config.py.
- The data is collected from [Leetify](https://leetify.com/app), so Members are required to have an account to see their rating.
